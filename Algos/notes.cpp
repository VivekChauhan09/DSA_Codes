#include<iostream>

// there are two types of header files
1. system header files : it comes with the compiler
eg: #include<iostream>

2. user defined header files : it is written by the programmer
eg: #include<anyname.h>
but a file named this.h must be created already else it will produce error

// visit cppreference.com    some are depricated like ==> - string.h is converted to cstring
